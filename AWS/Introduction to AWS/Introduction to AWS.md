[PDF Link](https://acloudguru-content-attachment-production.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/1597866222144-Lesson_03_Networking_and_Compute_Introduction%20to%20AWS.pdf)

- **AWS Global Infrastructure**
  - It's the actual physical infrastructure of Amazon Web Services.
  - It's the physical stuff that AWS runs on.
  - We break it down into three different areas.
  - Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.
  - **Regions**
    - Region is a place in the world where AWS resources exist.
    - Region is a geographical area.
  - **Availability Zones**
    - Each region consists of two or more availability zones.
    - An availability zone is simply a data center.
    - An availability zone could technically be a collection of data centers, but they're facilities that are very, very close to each other, and each availability zone is spaced away from another availability zone.
  - **Edge Locations**
    - An edge location is a content delivery network(CDN) endpoint for CloudFront.
    - CDN's a way to cache
    - What is CDN? (KOR) Link -> [https://goddaehee.tistory.com/173](https://goddaehee.tistory.com/173)

- **Services**
  - **Network and Content delivery**
    - **VPC**
      - It stands for Virtual Private Cloud.
      - VPC is like a virtual data center.
      - You have a VPC in all the different regions around the world.
    - **Route 53**
      - Route 53 is Amazon's DNS service.
      - 53 is the DNS port.
      - You can register domain names through Route 53.
    - **CloudFront**
      - CloudFront used to be in the storage section of AWS.
      - But they moved it over to networking and content delivery now.
      - For example

        ```text
        We have Direct Connect as a way of connecting up your office or connecting up your physical data centers to AWS directly using a dedicated line, dedicated telephone line.
        So instead of going over the internet, you're going over a dedicated line into AWS, and there are a few reasons you want to do that it might be around security but most of the time.
        it's because you need a very reliable internet connection. After all, you're pushing a lot of data up to AWS and down from AWS, and then you would use Direct Connect.
        ```

  - **Compute**
    - **EC2**
      - EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
      - EC2 is simply the virtual machines that run on AWS.
    - **EC2 Container Service**
      - EC2 Container Services is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers.
      - It allows you to run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
    - **Elastic Beanstalk**
      - If you don't know anything about AWS, and you want to deploy your code up into Amazon Web Services, you can just upload it to Elastic Beanstalk.
      - Elastic Beanstalk will then have a look at your code.
    - **Lambda**
      - Lambda is what we call serverless.
      - So you don't go into the operating system, you don't do anything with the underlying host at all.
      - It is one of the most revolutionary services of cloud computing.
      - You'd be able to log in using SSH or RDP if it was windows. And you'd be able to install things on this.
    - **Lightsail**
      - It's an out-of-the-box cloud.
      - So if you want a WordPress site or Joomla site, for example, Lightsail will deploy that for you automatically.

## 6. 10,000 ft Overview 2: Storage, Databases, Migration & Analytics

[PDF Link](https://acloudguru-content-attachment-production.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/1597867082600-Lesson_04_Storage%2C%20Databases%2C%20Migration%20%26%20Analytics_Introduction%20to%20AWS.pdf)

      - S3 is a Simple Storage Service, S, S, S.
      - S3 is always for object-based storage.
      - Just think of it as a virtual disk in the cloud where you can store objects like ppt, pictures, movies or etcetera.
      - What you don't use S3 for is things like, a place to install a database or a place to install an application may be a computer game. This is called object-based storage. You'd need block-based storage.
      - Dropbox stores all the metadata inside their own data centers. So, metadata is just data about data
    - **Glacier**
      - Glacier is a place in which you archive your files from S3 off
      - It's extremely, unbelievably low cost than S3.
      - But You can't access them immediately.

      - It's called Elastic File Service.
      - S3 is where you store objects, EFS is file-based storage and you can share it.
    - **Storage Gateway**
      - Storage Gateway is a way of connecting up S3 to your on-Premise data center or your headquarters.
      - It can, is normally a virtual machine that you install on-Premise. So you get a virtual machine image and then it communicates with S3.

      - Elasticache is a way of caching your data in the cloud.
      - It means that that data will be returned much quicker than if you're pulling it from your database.
  - **Migration**
    - **Snowball**
      - The AWS Snowball service uses physical storage devices to transfer large amounts of data between Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and your onsite data storage location at faster-than-internet speeds.
      - Snowball devices are physically rugged devices that are protected by the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
    - **DMS(Database Migration Service)**
      - AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it easy to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores.
    - **Server Migration Service(SMS)**

      - Athena allows you to run SQL queries on S3.
      - You can run SQL queries on CSV files or JSON files.

      - There are other frameworks available including Apache Spark, Apache HBase, Presto, or Flunk.
    - **Cloud Search**
      - Cloud Search is a fully managed service that's provided by AWS.
      - If you need to create a search engine for your website or your application, you know, you can use either cloud search or elastic search.
      - We used to use cloud search ourselves, but then we moved over to Algolia.
      - if you want to, you know, get off AWS and use a third party, I'd recommend Algolia.
    - **Elastic Search**
      - Elastic Search, it's a service that's using an open-source framework, but essentially it allows you to create search capabilities within your website or application.
    - **Kinesis**
