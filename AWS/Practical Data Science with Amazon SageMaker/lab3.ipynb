    "## Task 2: Tune a model\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist's typical machine learning (ML) process is composed of five major steps: preparing the data, training the model, tuning the model, deploying the model to an endpoint, and evaluating the model in production to retrain as needed. In the previous labs, you completed the data preparation and model training steps. In this lab, you complete model tuning. You can complete each of these steps in SageMaker Studio with access to powerful Jupyter notebook instances, built-in algorithms, model training, and model deployment within the service. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the training and tuning portions of the process, you typically work with data and feed it into a model where you evaluate the model’s prediction against the expected result. You keep a portion of your input data, the testing data, away from the training and validation data used to train and tune the model. In the next lab, you use the testing data to examine the behavior of your model on data it has never seen. For this lab, you use the training and validation data to tune your model. You tune the model by adjusting your hyperparameter configurations. The goal of these adjustments is to incrementally improve your output metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides automatic model tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, to find the best version of a model in an efficient manner. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning runs many training jobs on a dataset by using the specified algorithm and hyperparameter ranges. It then chooses the hyperparameter values that result in the best performing model, as determined by your chosen metric. You specify an ML model to tune, your objective metric, and the hyperparameters to use, And SageMaker hyperparameter tuning finds the best version of the model in a cost-effective way."

    "Selecting the right hyperparameter values for a machine learning model can be difficult. The correct answer depends on the algorithm and the data. Some algorithms have many tuneable hyperparameters. Some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected. And yet most have a nonlinear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values. Amazon SageMaker automatic model tuning helps by automating the hyperparameter tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use SageMaker automatic model tuning, you specify a range, or a list of possible values, for each hyperparameter that you choose to tune. SageMaker automatic model tuning runs multiple training jobs with various hyperparameter settings. It then evaluates the results of each job based on a specified objective metric and selects the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each tuning job, you specify a maximum number of training jobs, and the tuning completes when that number has been reached.\n",

    "- **alpha**: L1 regularization term on weights. Increasing this value makes models less complex by reducing possible overfitting. The trade-off is that models are less sensitive to the class of interest and less fit to your training dataset.\n",
    "- **eta**: Step size shrinkage used in updates to prevent overfitting. After each boosting step, you can directly get the weights of new features. The eta parameter actually shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative.\n",
    "- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of a tree. Increasing the depth might result in overfitting and decreasing the depth might result in underfitting.\n",

    "An objective metric is the value that the hyperparameter tuner is focused on optimizing. In this case, you are trying to maximize the validation area under the curve (AUC). AUC measures the ability of the model to predict a higher score for positive examples as compared to negative examples. Because it is independent of the score cut-off, you can get a sense of the prediction accuracy of your model from the AUC metric without picking a threshold. The AUC metric returns a decimal value from 0 to 1. A model with AUC of 0.50 is no better than a coin flip because it represents random chance, whereas a \"perfect\" model will have a score of 1.0. The higher AUC, the better your model can distinguish between frauds and legitimates. Values near 0 are unusual to see, and typically indicate a problem with the data. "
